// bare-town-quest-read.test.mjs — a bare town quest read answers the town's
// board instead of passing undefined into SQLite.
//
// THE DEFECT (postmark#2760, sophia 2026-09-13). `town { read: "quests" }` with
// no handle answered:
//
//     defect: "the office tripped"
//     hint:   "Provided value cannot be bound to SQLite parameter 1."
//
// The focused read contract names `quests` with no required argument, so the
// undefined handle went straight into `SELECT * FROM quest_progress WHERE
// handle = ?` and SQLite refused to bind it.
//
// IT ANSWERS RATHER THAN BOUNCING, and not as a preference: the household
// door's own bare-call bounce already promises this read — "The pots on the
// board are the town's, not any one resident's: town { read: "quests" } and
// household { read: "fund" } answer those with no resident named". One door was
// sending residents here for exactly this answer before the code could give it.
//
// AND THE RESIDENT FIELDS COME OFF RATHER THAN GOING TO ZERO. The town's
// `boardForHandle` defaults an absent progress row to a clean zero, which is
// right for a resident who has done nothing today and a lie for a read where
// nobody was named: `progress: 0` is a claim about a person.
//
// THE ONE FAKE HERE is the town's own pure `boardForHandle`, stubbed through a
// temp clone so these tests need no town checkout. Its two row shapes are
// `tools/quest-progress.mjs`'s own, quoted in the fixture below: a countable row
// carries progress/complete/counted/household, an uncounted row carries
// progress: null with the same three companions. Everything else — the guard,
// the lift of bounty postings, the pots, the note — is this office's real code.
