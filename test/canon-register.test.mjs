// canon-register.test.mjs — the falsifiers for the #2594 predicate.
//
// THE LAW THIS WAS BUILT FROM (Keemin, 2026-09-08 at the G1 sitting, verbatim —
// its lock-time half WITHDRAWN the same evening; the next section says where):
//
//   "refusal at the candle. A claim that would lock while the mark it
//    materializes has no file on main at the locking crossing is REFUSED at the
//    clearing job's lock step, naming the slug and the world sha — not held for
//    review."
//
// ── WHERE THIS PREDICATE IS ASKED, AND WHERE IT IS NOT (RE-RULED 2026-09-08) ─
//
// NOT at the candle. The reviewer timed the two units' journals over seven
// consecutive crossings and the settlement's push lands three to four minutes
// AFTER the candle clears — never once before — so a canon check at the lock
// step refuses the marks its own crossing just locked. Keemin withdrew the
// lock-time refusal the same evening. This predicate now serves the NIGHTLY read
// on the notary rail, where the push is nine hours old, and the `fold` backend
// at the G1 swap.
//
// ── WHAT THESE CAN AND CANNOT PROVE ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `falsifier-canon-locks.mjs` and `review-rule.mjs` — this predicate's two
// callers — are CLI tools: `process.argv`, `process.exit`, a store URL from the
// environment. So no test here reaches their WIRING, and nothing in
// `clearing-job.mjs` calls this predicate at all since the withdrawal. That is a
// property of the files' shape, not of their content, and saying otherwise is
// the defect this room has already recorded once (the hydrate fold,
// 2026-09-08). What these prove is the PREDICATE. What proves the read's wiring
// is the rehearsal in `docs/2026-09-08/jetto-candle-refusal-report.md` § C —
// the read on the pre-cutover dump, five findings, then one after the retire —
// and the lap-4 review's run of it against prod on the notary rail.
//
// ── THE CAN-FAIL FLIP, REPRODUCIBLE ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// In `world2/tools/canon-register.mjs § canonAbsentAmong`, delete the membership
// test so every named claim is reported absent:
//
//     -    if (register.slugs.has(slug)) continue;
//
// That is the shape of "the check refuses everything", which is the failure the
// 26-of-27 measurement in the file's header is about. Its split is recorded in
// the report beside the run.
//
// The OTHER flip, and it is the one that matters, is the reverse — delete the
// push instead, so the check never refuses anything:
//
//     -    absent.push({ id: c.id, slug, check: canonAbsentCheck(slug, register.sha) });
//
// A test suite that only reds on the first flip is watching the town's safety and
// not the ruling's; both are run, and both splits are in the report.

// ── 6 · THE REGISTER AT A NAMED SHA (2026-09-12) ─────────────────────────────
//
// WHY THIS SIBLING EXISTS, and it is a defect a reviewer caught in the carry
// lane rather than a generalisation anyone wanted.
//
// `canonRegisterAt` stamps `git rev-parse HEAD` and reads the WORKING TREE. For
// the notary at 03:20 those are the same state and the answer is right. For the
// settlement crossing they are NOT: `deploy/settlement-auto.sh` reads
// `WORLD_FROM` from `origin/main` and checks the clone out at it (:303-304), and
// then COMMITS `WORLD/households.json` onto that same clone whenever the
// household registry moved (:386-395) — the script says so itself at :418-425,
// "main may already be ahead of origin/main at this line, because the registry
// refresh commits before the fold". So on any crossing after a household
// declaration, HEAD is one commit past `WORLD_FROM`, and a register stamped HEAD
// would make the fold's own equality check refuse a crossing that was fine.
//
// THE FIX IS NOT TO LOOSEN THE CHECK. It is to make the register answer about
// the sha the crossing names, so `register.sha === worldSha` holds BY
// CONSTRUCTION and the equality check stays as the falsifier for the day
// something else moves.
//
// THE TREE IS MATERIALIZED AND `loadMarks` IS STILL THE ONE PARSER. Enumerating
// `git ls-tree -r --name-only <sha>` and reading slugs off the PATHS would be a
// second reader and a recorded defect besides: the identity is `by/<leaf>` where
// `by` comes from the mark's own frontmatter, and "the PATH is a different string
// and is never the identity" (`review-g1-retire.md` repair 1). So the blobs at
// the sha are written to a scratch directory and the checkout's own loader reads
// them, exactly as it reads a checkout.
//
// The fixture below therefore ships a `loadMarks` that REALLY READS THE
// DIRECTORY it is handed. The stub used by the tests above returns a constant,
// which cannot tell a read at a sha from a read at HEAD — it would pass on the
// broken function.
