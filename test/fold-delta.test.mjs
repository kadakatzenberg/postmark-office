// ── THE PREMISE THAT WAS TRUE ONLY WHERE IT WAS USED ────────────────────────
//
// `foldDelta` reads `marks WHERE locked_window = <closed>` where the ruling
// names `claims WHERE window_id = <closed> AND status = 'locked'`. The first
// version of its header justified that with a COUNT — "33 and 33 at window 177"
// — and a count is not an identity. Measured read-only against prod 2026-09-09,
// reproducing the reviewer's figures exactly:
//
//   window 177   33 marks · 33 claims · 17 SHARED IDS · 33 shared slugs
//   window 176    4 marks ·  4 claims ·  4 shared ids ·  4 shared slugs
//   window 172  116 marks · 118 claims · TWO slugs in claims and not in marks
//                (berthillon/cone-blue-moon-2026-08-30 and
//                 wright/the-flip-day-plumb-line, both now locked_window = 177)
//
// `claims.window_id` is historical; `marks.locked_window` is latest-wins. They
// agree by slug only at the NEWEST closed window, where "most recently locked"
// and "locked here" are the same sentence. One window back, the docket is no
// longer recoverable from `marks`.
//
// The crossing's own clearing wait runs to 240 s, so a replay or a catch-up
// crossing landing on an older window is not hypothetical — and its shortfall
// would be unattributable, because each omitted mark simply is not in the fold.
// So this refuses instead.
//
// The client here is a stub: `foldDelta` speaks to a `pg` client through exactly
// one method, and every assertion below is about which query it refuses at,
// which is a property of the code and not of a database.

// ── AFTER THE REVIEW (2026-09-12): THE TWO THE READER FOUND ──────────────────
//
// 1 · THE EQUALITY WAS NOT "BY CONSTRUCTION" AND THIS LANE SAID IT WAS.
//
// `deploy/settlement-auto.sh` reads `WORLD_FROM` from `origin/main` and checks
// `$SWEEP` out at it (:303-304) — and then COMMITS `WORLD/households.json` onto
// that same clone whenever the household registry moved (:386-395). The script
// documents it at :418-425: "main may already be ahead of origin/main at this
// line, because the registry refresh commits before the fold." `canonRegisterAt`
// stamps `git rev-parse HEAD`, so on any crossing after a household is declared
// the register's sha is ONE COMMIT PAST the fold's `worldSha`, the equality check
// below throws, `fold-input-cli.mjs` turns it into `store-refused`, and THE
// CROSSING PUBLISHES NOTHING. A household was declared on 2026-09-12, so this
// would have fired at 05:45Z.
//
// The carry itself was never wrong — the registry commit touches only
// `households.json` and the marks tree is byte-identical. The EQUALITY TEST READ
// THE WRONG INSTRUMENT. The repair is not to loosen it: the register is now read
// AT `worldSha` (`canon-register.mjs § canonRegisterAtSha`), so the equality
// holds by construction and the check below stays as the falsifier for the day
// something other than the registry moves main before the fold.
//
// 2 · A NULL HOUSEHOLD IN THE CARRIED TERM WOULD REFUSE EVERY CROSSING.
//
// `marks.household` is nullable (`001_tables.sql`), and `normalizeMark` refuses
// the WHOLE fold input with `mark-without-household`. A door-locked docket mark
// always carries one, so the docket never meets this. The carried term draws from
// the whole standing corpus, so ONE canon-absent standing mark with a null
// household would have refused every crossing until somebody edited the store by
// hand. A carried candidate with no household is NAMED AND SKIPPED.
